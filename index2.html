        <h2><strong>Hometown</strong></h2><br>
        Born and raised in San Diego, California. Jannah has always been a true and proud Californian. Even while
        attending university, she has never strayed too far from her home and attended the University of California, Irvine,  
        </div>

        <div class="col-xs-3">
        <h2><strong>Education</strong></h2><br>
        She graduated from UCI with a major in Pharmaceutical Sciences and a minor in Economics. Jannah has always worked in
        a pharmacy related setting, but when it was time to head to pharmacy school, she declined and experienced what
        some would call a quarter-life crisis.

        <h2><strong>Why Coding?</strong></h2><br>
        For the past three years, Jannah has worked as a Native English Teacher and Lecturer in 
        Seoul, South Korea and Tokyo, Japan. During this time, she realized the importance
        of web development and how it's incorporated into the everyday lives of people around the world, whether it be through social settings
        managing clinical information, or even keeping track of student data.

        <div class="col-xs-3">
        <h2><strong>Current Status</strong></h2><br>
        Since then, Jannah has been working as technical support at a innovative insulin pump company, but aspires to 
        learn more about the coding world.
        When she's not trying out new food places or sleeping, catch her on some hikes or at the movies.
